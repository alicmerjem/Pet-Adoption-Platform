# Pet-Adoption-Platform

This project is a pet adoption platform (website) built for the Foundations of Web Development course assignment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this website is to help connect future pet owners by providing a platform where users can view pets available for adoption. 

The project utilizes various web technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. JavaScript plays a key role in enhancing the functionality and interactivity of the website. Leveraging my previous knowledge of JavaScript, I applied it to several key areas, enhancing the overall user experience.

1. Dynamic image styling - Manipulation of the CSS images dynamically. Interactive visual experience is provided when users interact with the web page.
2. User registration form - The registration form is managed by JavaScript in order to handle form validation and submission. A mock API was used for the form submission, while JavaScript handled the redirection to the main page and submission of the data to the API.
3. Geolocation API - JavaScript is used to display user's geographical location.
4. Drag and drop API - Implemented inside of the Adoption Form in order to drag and drop pictures of animals inside of the field.
